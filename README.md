# Course DIT181 - Data Structure and Algorithms - Group 26

This repository is used to save the exercisies done during the course DIT181 - Data Structure and Algorithms.

The group consisted of 3 people.

## Learnings
We had 4 labs where we solved some issues while:
* Implemeting data structures such as trees (scapegoat, BST).
* Sorting algorithms (Insertion sort, Merge sort and Quicksort).
* Calculating algorithm complexity.
* Implementing algorithms (random, ucs, astar) to solve praph problems and calculating the shortest path between two nodes.

The code used to perform the labs is Java.
